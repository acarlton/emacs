To enable these files, add this to the top your .emacs:

;; load shared config
(setq shared-config-dir "~/apps/emacs/")
(load-file (concat shared-config-dir "dotemacs.el"))

where "~/app/emacs/" is the directory you cloned this repo to.

You can add custom settings after these lines in your .emacs file.
